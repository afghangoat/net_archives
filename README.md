# My .Net archives

A fat .zip of my .Net projects. Some of them are C#, C++, some of them are Visual Basic windows forms apps, but most of them are unfinished.

## Contents

- Projects which automates things (like homework solver, don't judge me, I was 10 when I made that)
- A window which escapes from you.
- Saas
- A bunch of other things

## Usage

Loading them would require Visual Studio 2017. Untested with later versions.
